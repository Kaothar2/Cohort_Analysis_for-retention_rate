# COHORT ANALYSIS PROJECT

Cohort analysis involves dividing users into distinct groups, or cohorts, based on certain criteria. In this case study, these cohorts are defined by the time of user acquisition. By grouping users together based on time of acquisition, we can study how different cohorts behave in terms of engagement and retention.

For example, you might create cohorts based on the month users first signed up for your service. You can then track how each cohort's activity, such as their conversion rate or lifetime value, evolves over time. This approach allows you to identify trends, anomalies, and areas where you may need to make adjustments to improve user retention and satisfaction.

## Retention Rate Time-Based Cohort Analysis:

Retention rate time-based cohort analysis is a specialized form of cohort analysis that focuses on the retention of users over multiple time periods.

To perform retention rate time-based cohort analysis, you would typically:

- Create cohorts based on user acquisition dates.

- Measure the percentage of users from each cohort who continue to engage with your product or service over time (e.g., after 1 month, 3 months, etc.).

- Analyze how retention rates vary across different cohorts and time periods, enabling you to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

This analysis can reveal whether certain cohorts have better or worse retention rates, helping the business understand the factors contributing to user retention or attrition. It can also assist in optimizing marketing, product development, and customer support strategies.

## OBSERVATIONS

A healthy retention rate for e-commerce platforms is typically considered to be in the range of 20% to 40%. This means that 20% to 40% of your customers continue to make purchases from your e-commerce platform after their initial purchase.

- December 2010 Cohort Outperforms Others: The fact that the December 2010 cohort has a retention rate above 30% is a positive sign. It suggests that this group of customers has remained engaged with your e-commerce platform over time. This could be due to various factors, such as the quality of your products/services, effective marketing, or a strong customer retention strategy.

- Decline in December 2011: The observation that all cohorts have low retention rates in December 2011 suggests that there may have been specific challenges or issues affecting customer retention during that time. It's important to investigate what might have caused this decline and whether it's a one-time event or a recurring pattern

- Variability in Retention Rates: The range of retention rates, from a minimum of 8% to a maximum of 50%, suggests that there is significant variability in how different cohorts of customers are behaving. While 8% is relatively low, 50% is relatively high, considering the standard e-commerce retention rates mentioned earlier.In addtion to observing the behaviour of each cohort, we can create a table which shows the average quantity of product bought by each cohort and how it fluctuates.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

- Identify Factors Driving High Retention (December 2010): Analyze what factors have contributed to the high retention rate for the December 2010 cohort. Was there a specific marketing campaign, product improvement, or customer engagement strategy that worked well for this group? Try to replicate successful strategies for other cohorts.

- Investigate December 2011 Drop: Investigate why all cohorts have low retention rates on December 2011. It might involve analyzing customer feedback, product quality, customer service, or any changes in your business operations during that time. Identifying and addressing the root causes of this drop is crucial for improving future retention rates.

- Set Realistic Targets: While the standard e-commerce retention rate range is 20% to 40%, it's essential to set targets that are specific to your business and its circumstances. Aim to improve retention rates gradually over time based on your historical data and industry benchmarks.

- Implement Retention Strategies: Develop and implement retention strategies that are tailored to different cohorts of customers. Personalized marketing, loyalty programs, and targeted communication can help improve retention rates.

- Continuously Monitor and Adapt: Retention rates can change over time due to various factors, so it's crucial to continuously monitor them and adapt your strategies accordingly. Regularly analyzing cohort data and customer behavior will help you make informed decisions to improve retention.

- Now the company knows its customer segments, how customers in those segments behave, and what they are interested in. This information can help target the company audience better and, therefore, increase sales and ROI

This can serve as a signal to carryout targetted marketing in countries where more quantites are sold in contrast to targeting countries where more customers are acquired.
